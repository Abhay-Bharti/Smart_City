        Today, cities are getting “smarter” to provide for improved delivery and
        quality of services through continuous monitoring of residents and
        infrastructure, and relatively instantaneous communication of suboptimal
        performance. To a large extent, this requires heavy reliance on
        automation, connectivity to the internet, and what is referred to as the
        “Internet of Things (IoT).” (Internet of Things refers to connecting
        devices to the internet that can be controlled or can be used to send
        control information).
      </p>

      <p>
        A smart city, then, is a city in which a suite of sensors (typically
        hundreds or thousands) is deployed to collect electronic data from and
        about people and infrastructure so as to improve efficiency and quality
        of life. Residents and city workers, in turn, may be provided with apps
        that allow them to access city services, receive and issue reports of
        outages, accidents, and crimes, pay taxes, fees, and the like. In the
        smart city, energy efficiency and sustainability are emphasized.

          <p>
            Topping most lists when it comes to smart cities is often Singapore.
            Since launching its Smart Nation initiative in 2014, Singapore has
            introduced a wide range of smart technologies in both its public and
            private sectors. Contactless payment technology has been widely
            adopted to efficiently direct movement and payments for Singapore’s
            7.5 million passengers who use public transports. To help elevate
            the pressure of an ageing population, a digital health system was
            introduced – normalising video consultations at the same time – as
            well as wearable Internet of Things devices to monitor patients.
            What’s more, Singapore announced in 2021 its plans for a new
            eco-smart city that is entirely vehicle-free. To be located in
            Tengah in the western region of Singapore, the planned forest city
            will be home to five residential districts with 42,000 houses, as
            well as safe zones for both pedestrians and cyclists.

          <h1><u>Helsinki</u></h1>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            Helsinki has set themselves an aim of going carbon neutral by 2035
            and they are proved to be on their way in reaching the goal. Even
            back in 2017, the city managed to lower emissions by 27% than it was
            in 1990. Another goal Helsinki is working towards is reducing
            traffic emissions by 69% within three decades by 2035, with measures
            like transitioning the entire city bus fleet to electric, and
            expanding its Metro and electric car charging networks. Since
            heating accounts for more than half of Helsinki’s emissions, the
            city is focused on implementing energy-efficiency measures during
            renovations, which could reduce emissions from buildings by 80%, as
            well as incorporating more renewable energy use in the city’s
            buildings.

          <p>
            Hundreds of smart sensors and technologies have been tested and
            placed through the different districts in New York City as part of
            its smart city pilot programme in 2020. The programme amasses data
            to help manage services like waste management and collection more
            efficiently. New York has also seen the introduction of smart hubs
            with contactless technology, WiFi capabilities as well as online
            charging stations in place of phone booths. Car sharing services are
            also huge in the Big Apple, which helps reduce total emissions and
            traffic congestions. As an attempt to culminate more local
            perspectives and creativity, New York City holds an annual contest –
            with a generous cash prize – for apps that best utilise the city’s
            open data sets.

          <p>
            Home to Songdo, also known as the world’s first smart city, Seoul’s
            smart technology campaigns have only gone from strength to strength
            since launching its initiatives as early as 2014. Data is at the
            heart of Seoul’s smart city projects. Through the accumulation and
            analysis of urban patterns such as traffic flow, speed and air
            quality measured by sensors and CCTV deployed across the city, form
            a strong basis for a smart infrastructure and services. Focusing the
            technology towards the city’s ageing population, a safety initiative
            was launched in aid of senior citizens who live alone. When there’s
            no movement detected over a certain period of time or if abnormal
            temperature, humidity, or lighting are picked up by environmental
            sensors, relevant case workers and emergency services would be
            contacted immediately. Likewise, Seoul is looking into using the
            data platform creating an AI detective to flag up potential crime
            patterns. At the moment, thanks to the 5G network, the Korean
            capital is also amongst the first cities to utilise 5G technology in
            mobility and transportation.

          Smart cities use a variety of software, user interfaces and
          communication networks alongside the Internet of Things (IoT) to
          deliver connected solutions for the public. Of these, the IoT is the
          most important. The IoT is a network of connected devices that
          communicate and exchange data. This can include anything from vehicles
          to home appliances and on-street sensors. Data collected from these
          devices is stored in the cloud or on servers to allow for improvements
          to be made to both public and private sector efficiencies and deliver
          economic benefits and improvements to the lives of citizens. Many of
          the IoT devices use edge computing, which ensures that only the most
          relevant and important data is delivered over the communication
          network. In addition, a security system is implemented to protect,
          monitor and control the transmission of data from the smart city
          network and prevent unauthorised access to the IoT network of city’s
          data platform. Alongside the IoT solutions, smart cities also use
          technologies including: Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) Cloud Computing Services Dashboards
          Machine Learning Machine-to-Machine Communications Mesh Networks

        <ul>Combining automation, machine learning and the IoT is allowing for the adoption of smart city technologies for a variety of applications. For example, smart parking can help drivers find a parking space and also allow for digital payment</ul>
        <ul>Another example would be smart traffic management to monitor traffic flows and optimise traffic lights to reduce congestion, while ride-sharing services can also be managed by a smart city infrastructure.

        Smart city features can also include energy conservation and environmental efficiencies, such as streetlights that dim when the roads are empty. Such smart grid technologies can improve everything from operations to maintenance and planning to power supplies.</ul>
        <ol>Smart city initiatives can also be used to combat climate change and air pollution as well as waste management and sanitation via internet-enabled rubbish collection, bins and fleet management systems.

            Aside from services, smart cities allow for the provision of safety measures such as monitoring areas of high crime or using sensors to enable an early warning for incidents like floods, landslides, hurricanes or droughts.
            
            Smart buildings can also offer real-time space management or structural health monitoring and feedback to determine when repairs are necessary. Citizens can also access this system to notify officials of any problems, such as potholes, while sensors can also monitor infrastructure problems such as leaks in water pipes.</ol>

            Smart cities offer plenty of benefits to improve citizen safety, such as connected surveillance systems, intelligent roadways and public safety monitoring, but what about protecting the smart cities themselves?

            There is a need to ensure smart cities are protected from cyber attacks, hacking and data theft while also making sure the data that is reported is accurate.
            
            In order to manage the security of smart cities there is a need to implement measures such as physical data vaults, resilient authentication management and ID solutions. Citizens need to trust the security of smart cities which means government, private sector enterprise, software developers, device manufacturers, energy providers and network service managers need to work together to deliver integrated solutions with core security objectives. These core security objectives can be broken down as follows:
            <br><br>
            Availability :- Data needs to be available in real time with reliable access in order to make sure it performs its function in monitoring the various parts of the smart city infrastructure
            <br> Inegrity :- The data must not only be readily available, but it must also be accurate. This also means safeguarding against manipulation from outside
            <br> Confidentiality :- Sensitive data needs to be kept confidential and safe from unauthorised access. This may mean the use of firewalls or the anonymising of data
            <br> Accountability :- System users need to be accountable for their actions and interaction with sensitive data systems. Users logs should record who is accessing the information to ensure accountability should there be any problems
            <br> Legislation is already being put in place in different nations, such as the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act in the United States to help determine and establish minimum security requirements for connected devices in smart cities.
            <br>   <br><br>         
            Cities across the world are in different stages of smart technology development and implementation. However, there are several who are ahead of the curve, leading the path to creating fully smart cities. These include:
            <br>
            Barcelona, Spain <br>
            Columbus, Ohio, USA <br>
            Dubai, United Arab Emirates <br>
            Hong Kong, China  <br>
            Kansas City, Missouri, USA  <br>
            London, England <br>
            Melbourne, Australia  <br>
            New York City, New York, USA  <br>
            Reykjavik, Iceland  <br>
            San Diego, California, USA  <br>
            Singapore <br>
            Tokyo, Japan  <br>
            Toronto, Canada <br>
            Vienna, Austria <br><br>
            The city state of Singapore is considered to be one of the front-runners in the race to creating fully smart cities, with IoT cameras monitoring the cleanliness of public spaces, crowd density and the movement of registered vehicles. Singapore also has systems to monitor energy use, waste management and water use in real time. In addition, there is autonomous vehicle testing and a monitoring system to ensure the health and wellbeing of senior citizens. 
            
            Elsewhere, Kansas City has introduced smart streetlights, interactive kiosks and over 50 blocks of free Wi-Fi. Parking space details, traffic flow measurement and pedestrian hotpots are also all available to residents via the city's data visualization app.
            
            San Diego, meanwhile, has installed 3,200 smart sensors to optimise traffic flow and parking as well as enhancing public safety and environmental awareness. Electric vehicles are supported by solar-to-electric charging stations and connected cameras monitor for traffic problems and crime.
            
            Traffic monitoring systems are also in place in Dubai, which has telemedicine and smart healthcare solutions as well as smart buildings, utilities, education and tourism options. Barcelona also has smart transportation systems with bus stops offering free Wi-Fi and USB charging ports, along with a bike-sharing programme and a smart parking app including online payment options. Temperature, pollution and noise are also measured using sensors that also cover humidity and rainfall.
